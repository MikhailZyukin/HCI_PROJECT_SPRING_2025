# RESEARCH PHASE 1.3 â€” BASIC DESIGN DECISIONS

## Interface Type:

- The system will use a **WIMP interface (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer)** optimized for touchscreens (tablets and phones) and desktop browsers.
- Interactions will primarily be **mouse/touch-based**, with drag-and-drop mechanics for games and simple icon-based menus.

## Input/Output Devices:

- **Input:** Touchscreen, mouse
- **Output:** Visual UI and basic auditory feedback (sound effects, narration for younger children)

## Technical Constraints:

- Needs to support both desktop and mobile browsers (responsive design)
- Should be able to run smoothly with limited internet connection and low-end hardware
- Needs to be scalable to support simultaneous parent-child sessions
