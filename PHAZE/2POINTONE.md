# RESEARCH PHASE 2.1 Usability Goals

- **Learnability:** New users (children or parents) can understand navigation within 1â€“2 minutes.
- **Efficiency:** Children complete tasks in under 3 steps; parents find information in under 5 seconds.
- **Memorability:** Repeated actions are reinforced through consistent iconography and visual cues.
- **Error Handling:** Clear visual/audio feedback provided when an action fails (e.g., mismatch).
- **Satisfaction:** Parent and child both report a positive, stress-free experience.
