# RESEARCH PHASE 1.1

## User Definition:
- The web app targets children aged 5–10 and their parents. These users may access the platform from home, school, or therapy centers. Educators and psychologists may also serve as secondary users for oversight and support.
## Data Gathering Activities:
- Online Surveys were distributed to parents and caregivers to understand children's emotional challenges and digital
habits.
- Expert Interviews with child psychologists and teachers provided qualitative insight into what emotionally
supportive tools should look like.
- Usability Walkthroughs of similar web apps helped identify common issues and good practices in child-centered design.
## Task Analysis:
- Parent logs in and creates a child profile
- Child navigates a visual story or game that targets an emotional theme (e.g., frustration)
- Joint session: Parent and child reflect on the task
- Dashboard shows emotion tracking and progress
## Personas and Scenarios:

###  Persona 1: Sarah – The Supportive Parent
