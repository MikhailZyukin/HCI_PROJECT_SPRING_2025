# EMOTIONAL INTELLEGENCE APPLICATION

## The goal of our project is to assist children struggling with emotional intelligence.

- Emotional intelligence is imperative for a brighter future 
and it is our responsibility to enlighten the younger generation on its importance,
as many issues in the early life of achild could stem from misunderstandings cause lack of said EI.

- We aim to assist children and their parents in a healthy way
through joint activities that help the parents convey their thoughts & emotions
towards their children in the way a child can comprehend.

- This will be accomplished primarily through simple games in which both parties require participation.On the technical side the games will be aimed to split at different age groups for children , as children of varying ages may exhibit struggle pertaining certain aspects of EI.
For younger age groups more simple games are to be implemented such as emotional matching in which face showing emotion should be matched as simple assossciations in which parents can assist by my mimicing emotions portrayed on the screen this will reinforce the parent as a positive figure in the childs life as well as help it with understanding of basic behavioural patterns with age however the games will get become more advanced and have more details implemented as the child ages. In short we aim to improve the quality of life for families from vaious backgrounds with games as a median of bonding and learning EI.
