# LITERATURE REVIEW

Emotional intelligence (EI) plays a critical role in children’s development, especially during early childhood when
foundational emotional and social skills are formed (Denham et al., 2011). 

High EI is linked to improved relationships, academic success, and emotional well-being.
It also acts as a protective factor against behavioral problems, including aggression (Gao et al., 2023).

Fiori and Vesely-Maillefer (2020) emphasize that EI consists of measurable mental abilities, such as identifying,
understanding, and managing emotions.
These are skills that can be strengthened through intentional learning experiences. Research supports using
technology as a scalable and engaging method for delivering EI-related content, especially when it includes elements
like emotional modeling, feedback, and storytelling (Pons et al., 2015; Karabekiroğlu et al., 2024).

Crucially, parent-child relationships provide a foundation for emotional growth.
Children learn best when they engage in co-regulated emotional experiences with a caregiver (Zhou et al., 2020).
Therefore, digital tools that embed joint activities or encourage emotional reflection between parent and child hold
particular promise.
Cultural and developmental considerations must also inform the design of any digital intervention. 
Emotional expression and parental practices differ across cultures, and age-appropriateness ensures children can
meanigfully interact with and benefit from emotional content (Yıldız, 2015; Zhang et al., 2022).
It is important that any game or app designed to support EI be tailored to the developmental level of the child and
account for cultural contexts that shape emotional expression and regulation.
Research from diverse populations, such as studies conducted in China and Turkey, supports the generalizability of
EI-based interventions across cultures but also points to the need for customization(Zhang et al., 2022; Yıldız, 2015).
Gao et al. (2023) investigated the relationship between emotional intelligence and aggressive behavior in children.
Their study confirmed that higher emotional intelligence is associated with lower levels of aggression, mediated
through both positive and negative affect. Children who can understand and regulate their emotional experiences are
less likely to exhibit reactive or proactive aggression. The authors highlight that EI enhances resilience, helping
children manage negative emotions in constructive ways. This underscores the potential of emotionally focused
interventions—including games and digital apps—as preventive tools for emotional and behavioral issues.
